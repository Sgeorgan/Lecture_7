    "Python boasts a plethora of excellent libraries for data visualization. The diagram illustrates various available plotting libraries and their interrelationships. Among these, we particularly recommend:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org): Often hailed as the foundational plotting library in Python, Matplotlib offers extensive options for creating static, animated, and interactive plots. Explore diverse visualizations in the [Matplotlib Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Matplotlib Basemap Toolkit**](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/): This Matplotlib plugin enables easy map plotting. However, it's worth noting that Basemap is being deprecated in favor of [**Cartopy**](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/gallery/index.html), which offers advanced map-making capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org): Built on Matplotlib, Seaborn simplifies the creation of beautiful statistical graphics. Find inspiration in the [Seaborn Gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Bokeh**](https://bokeh.org): For modern, interactive web-based plots, Bokeh is a fantastic choice. It supports a wide range of visualization types, as seen in the [Bokeh Gallery](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Plotly**](https://plotly.com/python/): Plotly offers similar capabilities to Bokeh, with additional features for creating sophisticated interactive web-based visualizations. Some functionalities are premium. Explore the [Plotly Gallery](https://plotly.com/python/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Dash**](https://plotly.com/dash/): This framework is designed for building analytical web applications entirely in Python, eliminating the need for JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**ggplot**](http://yhat.github.io/ggpy/): Inspired by the R library ggplot2, ggplot for Python allows R users to apply familiar plotting concepts in Python. Check out [ggplot examples](http://yhat.github.io/ggpy/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**HoloViews**](http://holoviews.org) and [**GeoViews**](http://geoviews.org): These libraries focus on letting the data visualize itself, with HoloViews tailored for basic plotting ([HoloViews tutorial and examples](http://holoviews.org/Tutorials/index.html)) and GeoViews for creating interactive maps ([GeoViews Gallery](http://geoviews.org/gallery/index.html)).\n",

    "### Anatomy of a Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the anatomy of a plot is crucial before diving into data visualization. Although this guide won't cover the intricacies of various plot types, it aims to introduce the basic components common across many plots and the diverse range of plots available for representing data characteristics using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Plot Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a multitude of plot types, each designed for distinct data representation needs. Below are some widely used plot types, along with links to their Wikipedia entries for further exploration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Bar Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_chart): Useful for comparing quantities across different categories.\n",
    "- [Histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram): Ideal for visualizing the distribution of numerical data.\n",
    "- [Scatter Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot): Excellent for examining the relationship between two variables.\n",
    "- [Line Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart): Effective for displaying data trends over time.\n",
    "- [Pie Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart): Suitable for showing the relative proportions of parts to a whole.\n",
    "- [Box Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot): Used for depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles.\n",
    "- [Violin Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot): Combines a box plot with a kernel density plot, ideal for comparing distribution shapes.\n",
    "- [Dendrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrogram): A tree-like diagram used to illustrate the arrangement of the clusters produced by hierarchical clustering.\n",
    "- [Chord Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_diagram): Useful for displaying the inter-relationships between data in a matrix format.\n",
    "- [Treemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping): Ideal for visualizing hierarchical data using nested rectangles.\n",
    "- [Network Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing): Visualizes relationships and flows between interconnected entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Essential Elements of a Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the vast array of plot types, most share certain foundational elements. Familiarity with these elements simplifies the creation and customization of plots, making it easier to communicate your data's story effectively. These elements include axes (x-axis and y-axis), data points, legends, titles, and more. While specific features may vary between different plot types, understanding these common components is invaluable for anyone working in data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a basic understanding of a plot's structure, consider a simple line chart, which typically features an x-axis, y-axis, data points connected by lines, and often a legend to clarify the data's meaning. This foundation applies broadly, helping guide the visualization process across various plot types.\n"

Bar plots are one option, which can be used quite similarly to line plots with the addition of the `kind=bar` parameter. Note that it is easiest to plot our selected time range for a bar plot by selecting the dates in our data series first, rather than adjusting the plot limits. pandas sees bar plot data as categorical, so the date range is more difficult to define for x-axis limits. For the y-axis, we can still define its range using the `ylim=[ymin, ymax]` parameter. Similarly, text placement on a bar plot is more difficult, and most easily done using the index value of the bar where the text should be placed.
