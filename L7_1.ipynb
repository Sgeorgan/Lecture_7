    "\n",
    "In addition to line plots, there are many other options for plotting in pandas. Bar plots are one option, which can be used quite similarly to line plots with the addition of the `kind=bar` parameter. Note that it is easiest to plot our selected time range for a bar plot by selecting the dates in our data series first, rather than adjusting the plot limits. pandas sees bar plot data as categorical, so the date range is more difficult to define for x-axis limits. For the y-axis, we can still define its range using the `ylim=[ymin, ymax]` parameter. Similarly, text placement on a bar plot is more difficult, and most easily done using the index value of the bar where the text should be placed. Let's select data for the first week of May in 2017, for Sweden."
